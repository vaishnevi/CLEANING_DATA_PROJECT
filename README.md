# CLEANING_DATA_PROJECT
Script : run_analysis.R
This code assumes that the dataset is present in the same working directory as the code. The dataset
also has the following structure:: UCI HAR Dataset being the main folder and the dataset being present
inside the main folder.

The Run_analysis.R script uses data from UCI HAR dataset which contains signals collected using gyrometers and accelerometers
from 30 subjects while performing different activities such as WALKING, LAYING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING
AND STANDING.

The Script performs the following:

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
